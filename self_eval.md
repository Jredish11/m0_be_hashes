# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
## Not much struggle, took me a minute to get everything down in the hashes lesson (vocab, key-value pairs).  Most of my struggles were due to syntax giving me output errors.  That helped me figure out the syntax as the lesson went a long.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
## It's going well. it's nice to have something that I can physically grab and refer to while working in my terminal or code editor.  I find myself taking most helpful notes when going through the assignments before the cfu.   
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
## I learn towards my notes first, then re check past cfu's or ruby practice files i've created.  then googling if I'm still stuck.  I also have been messing around with Chat GPT which is a chat bot that can provide answers to coding questions.  It's still in beta so I'm taking anything it spits out with grain of salt and checking in my own terminal/code editor.
